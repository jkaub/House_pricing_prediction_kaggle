 House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques is a famous start-up Kernel from Kaggle. I decided to use this Kernel in order to try new methods in order to tune hyper-parameters of my algorithms.
 
The use of the library hyperopt and a Bayesian optimization algorithm helped me improving my model by almost 10% in comparaison to my previous tries. 

It is also much faster and more accurate compare to a simple GridSearch algorithm
